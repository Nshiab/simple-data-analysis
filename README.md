# Simple data analysis

This project has two main goals:

- To encourage more data journalists, academics and web developers to dive into the wonderful world of data analysis and visualization in JavaScript.

- To accelerate my workflow (and hopefully yours) with a set of easy to use functions based on the best libraries out there.

The project is under development. Stay tuned.
